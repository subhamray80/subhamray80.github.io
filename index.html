    <p id="aboutsteam">Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released. Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.</p>

      <div id="desc">Before implementing Steam, Valve Corporation had problems updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches would result in most of the online user base disconnecting for several days. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user

        <div id="desc">Steam's development began in 2002, with working titles for the platform being "Grid" and "Gazelle".[12][13] It was first revealed to the public on March 22, 2002, at the Game Developers Conference, where it was presented purely as a distribution network.[14] To demonstrate the ease of integrating Steam with a game, Relic Entertainment created a special version of Impossible Creatures</div>

        <div id="desc">The Steam client was first made available for public beta testing in January 2003 during the beta period for Counter-Strike 1.6, for which it was mandatory to install and use. At the time, Steam's primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online computer games. Steam was an optional component for all other games. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period.</div>

  The base system draws from Debian 8, code named Debian Jessie.
  Our work builds on top of the solid Debian core	and	optimizes	it	for	a	living	room	experience.
  Most	of	all,	it	is	an open	Linux	platform	that	leaves	you	in	full	control.

   <p id="osdesc">SteamOS is designed primarily for playing video games away from a PC (such as from the couch in one's living room) by providing a console-like experience using generic PC hardware that can connect directly to a television. It can run games natively that have been developed for Linux and purchased from the Steam store. Users are also able to stream games from their Windows, Mac or Linux computers to one running SteamOS, and it incorporates the same family sharing and restrictions as Steam on the desktop.[3] Valve claims that it has "achieved significant performance increases in graphics processing" through SteamOS.[4] The operating system is open source, allowing users to build on or adapt the source code, though the actual Steam client is closed.</p>
