            <p id="desc">During a panel at LinuxCon in 2013, Valve co-founder and executive director Gabe Newell stated that he believed "Linux and open source are the future of gaming" (though his beliefs about games themselves being open source is unclear), going on to say that the company is aiding game developers who want to make games compatible with Linux, and that they would be making an announcement the following week related to introducing Linux into the living room.[17] On September 20, 2013, Valve posted a statement on its website titled The Steam Universe is Expanding in 2014 which teased three new announcements from them related to "even more ways to connect the dots for customers who want Steam in the living-room."[18][19] The first announcement was revealed on September 23 as SteamOS, </p>

      <p id="desc">n January 2014, GameSpot compared the performance to games running on Windows using identical hardware and settings with an AMD graphics card and a Nvidia graphics card. On the AMD graphics card, they found that Dota 2, Left 4 Dead 2 and Metro: Last Light all ran at considerably fewer frames-per-second under SteamOS. Left 4 Dead 2 also suffered from stuttering, which they attributed to a device driver problem. On the Nvidia graphics card Metro: Last Light ran at slightly higher frames per second, and Dota 2 ran at the same rate. They state that for Left 4 Dead 2 the Nvidia card actually performed better under SteamOS, but did not specify how as their chart indicated it performed at a lower frame rate. On both cards, Left 4 Dead 2 and Dota 2 both had longer load times compared to Windows.</p>
